# Flashbook

GUIs that:

  1) facilitate taking notes of PDFs of study books

  2) a flash card program to study them.
  
I created these two GUIs to ease the arduous task of reading (physics) study books, make notes of important formulas and then to study them. Flashbook requires that you convert a PDF to jpg files and put them in the corresponding “%localappdata%/Flashbook/books” folder.

You can take notes by simply selecting an area with your mouse, a rectangle will be drawn, you can do this multiple times and they will be combined to a single question or answer card. In addition to this you can type an additional question or answer in a textbox that will be combined with the selected areas. In this textbox you can include regular text but also LaTeX code, e.g. $\partial\beta$ to show ∂β. In addition you can also add LaTeX macros so that you can almost ask any (mathematical) question.
# NB
- In the ‘files’ subfolder you can define your own LaTeX macros
-	LaTeX environments like matrices are not included
